### C reports

Contains the reports for each of the techniques in the following format:
- **Technique@Test1O0** (using optimization level O0 without applying the technique)
- **Technique@Test2O0** (using optimization level O0 after applying the technique)
- **Technique@Test1O3** (using optimization level O3 without applying the technique)
- **Technique@Test203** (using optimization level O3 after applying the technique)

There are two global reports:  
- **testcases_total.xlsx**: Contains the results for all test cases.
- **testcases_averages_comparison.xlsx**: Provides a comparison of the different test cases.

Additionally, there is a folder named **SixSigma**, which contains supplementary materials.

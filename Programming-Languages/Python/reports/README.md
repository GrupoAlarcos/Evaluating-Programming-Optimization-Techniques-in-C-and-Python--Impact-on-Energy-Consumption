### Python reports

Contains the reports for each of the techniques in the following format:
- **Technique@Test1** (using the Python interpreter without applying the technique)
- **Technique@Test2** (using the Python interpreter after applying the technique)
- **Technique@Test1_Nuitka** (using the Nuitka compiler without applying the technique)
- **Technique@Test2_Nuitka** (using the Nuitka compiler after applying the technique)

There are two global reports:  
- **testcases_total.xlsx**: Contains the results for all test cases.
- **testcases_averages_comparison.xlsx**: Provides a comparison of the different test cases.

Additionally, there is a folder named **SixSigma**, which contains supplementary materials.

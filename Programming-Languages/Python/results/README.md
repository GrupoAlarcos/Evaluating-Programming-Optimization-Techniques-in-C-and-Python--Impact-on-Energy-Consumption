### Python results

Contains the results for each of the test cases in the following format:
- **Technique_Standard_Interpreter** (using the Python interpreter without applying the technique)
- **Technique_Efficient_Interpreter** (using the Python interpreter after applying the technique)
- **Technique_Standard_Nuitka** (using the Nuitka compiler without applying the technique)
- **Technique_Efficient_Nuitka** (using the Nuitka compiler after applying the technique)

In addition to the results mentioned above, there is a series of Excel files with the global results of the test cases. A folder named `images` contains visual representations of the data.
